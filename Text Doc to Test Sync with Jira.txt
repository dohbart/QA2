Jira / Git Smart Commits
------------------------

The basic syntax for a Smart Commit message is:

<ignored text> <ISSUE_KEY> <ignored text> #<COMMAND> <optional COMMAND_ARGUMENTS>

Any text between the issue key and the command is ignored.
There are three commands you can use in your Smart Commit messages:
- comment
- time
- transition


Example	- Comment
SP-57 #comment added smart commit info

Example - Time
SP-57 #time 1w 2d 4h 30m Total work logged

Example - Transition
SP-57 #close Fixed this today

Notes	
This example executes the close issue workflow transition for the issue and adds the comment 'Fixed this today' to the issue.
Note that the comment is added automatically without needing to use the #comment command.
